# Web-Scrapping-01
Scrapping code for information gathering from a public website.

Webscrapping is a tricky practice because you have to deal with other people's and other companies' information, but done with responsibility and respecting the privacy of the content and rights of the information can come in handy and save a LOT of time.

This code was created to help solving a problem of information gathering from a public website. For privacy and rights respect we will not post the real URL used or other information that might identify the source of the data.

The objective of this repository is to register the effort of creating the code and maybe help others with solutions for specific problems in similar codes.

I hope it is useful for anyone.
